Description: 
  This project is a tool for words edit similarity joins (a.k.a. all-pairs similarity search) under small (< 3) edit distance constraints. 
  It works for Levenshtein/Hamming distances and words from any alphabet. 
  The software was originally developed for joining amino-acid/nucleotide sequences from Adaptive Immune Repertoires, 
  where the number of words is relatively large (10^5-10^6) and the average length of words is relatively small (10-100).
